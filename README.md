# Mario Database Project

This project demonstrates the creation of a `Mario`-themed database using SQL. It includes characters, 
their information, associated sounds, actions, and the relationships between characters and actions.

## Table Structures

You can view detailed information about the database schema and sample data in the [`mario_database.sql`](mario_database.sql) file.

For a more readable overview of the table structures and sample data, check out the [Mario Tables Structure](mario_tables.md).

## How to Use

To recreate this database, run the SQL commands found in [`mario_database.sql`](mario_database.sql) in a PostgreSQL environment.
